            Any image maker who wants to start building a relationship with us may apply to become a
            FUJIFILM Collaborator. You do not need to be a professional photographer to apply. If your application is
            accepted, this introduction allows us to collectively begin collaborating on ideas and helps lay the
            foundation for a successful, long-term working relationship.
        </p>

                    At this stage, you most likely will not work with us on large campaigns or product launches, but we
                    will endeavor to find projects to do with you that can be featured on our social media and digital
                    channels.

                    Being a FUJIFILM Collaborator is that it will help you learn how to work with the FUJIFILM brand,
                    allow you to see what having a professional relationship with us could look like, and ultimately
                    help you take the next steps towards becoming a successful FUJIFILM Creator.
